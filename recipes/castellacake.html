    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>40 grams cake flour</li>
        <li>35 grams salted butter</li>
        <li>30 grams whole milk</li>
        <li>30 grams white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol> 
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Gently separate the egg yolks and egg whites.</li>
        <li>Heat the milk and butter in a small pan. Don't get them boiling, heat them just enough to melt the butter. It should be warm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Sift your cake flour in another bowl. Pour the warm milk-butter mixture in and slowly mix everything using a whisk. It should become pretty sticky and viscous. After that, add the egg yolks and vanilla extract. Continue whisking until it is all well mixed, being careful to avoid air bubbles. </li>
        <li>To create the meringue, whisk your egg whites with cream of tartar and sugar at a high speed until it looks super creamy and fluffy.</li>
